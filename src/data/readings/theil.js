      overviewText:
        'Zero to One by Peter Thiel is a book about building unique, innovative businesses by creating something entirely new (going from 0 to 1) rather than copying or iterating on existing ideas (going from 1 to n). Thiel, a PayPal co-founder and investor, argues that true progress comes from vertical innovation and developing a monopoly in a new market, not from competition in an existing one. The book provides insights into how to achieve this, offering a framework for creating value through original thinking and identifying unique, defensible business ideas.',
