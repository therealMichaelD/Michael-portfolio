      overviewText:
        'In Play Nice But Win, Michael Dell provides a personal account of his career, from starting a computer business in his college dorm room to leading Dell Technologies through some of its most challenging moments. The book details three key battles: the launch of his company, the fight to take it private in 2013 against activist investor Carl Icahn, and the transformation of the business through the massive acquisition of EMC in 2016. Throughout his story, Dell shares lessons on leadership, the importance of a long-term vision over short-term market pressures, and how a guiding principle of "playing nice but winning" shaped his approach to building a company that would last.',

      quotes: ['In business you can surround yourself with the smartest people, you can plan ahead with the greatest care and intelligence, but one thing you can count on is that from time to time you’ll get smacked in the face with a flounder—aka something you’d never anticipated.','Growth covers up a lot of sins.','The way I describe this when talking with businesspeople is that the domain of technology is no longer in the IT department; the whole company is technology. I’m talking about all companies. If you’re trying to make cars or medical devices or any kind of product at all, and you want to have new customers, technology is the fulcrum of progress in everything you’re doing.','A corporation is a living organism. It has to continue to shed its skin. Methods have to change. Focus has to change. Values have to change. The sum total of those changes is transformation.'],
