              Hi, I‚Äôm Michael Dang ‚Äî a Master‚Äôs in Engineering Management and Bachelor‚Äôs in Electrical Engineering student at Dartmouth College, passionate about technology management and building at the intersection of software and hardware.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-800 text-base sm:text-lg leading-7">
              Originally from Toronto, Canada, I‚Äôm especially interested in semiconductors, software, and product management, where I can combine technical depth with strategic thinking to create impactful solutions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-800 text-base sm:text-lg leading-7">
              I love exploring side projects that push me to learn and build. A few of my favorite builds include a TinyML wake-word lamp, an Arduino-based oscilloscope, and an ESP32 Smart Power Meter.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-800 text-base sm:text-lg leading-7">
              Outside of work and school, you‚Äôll often find me supporting my Toronto sports teams, running, spending time outdoors, or diving into books and podcasts on tech, leadership, and innovation.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-800 text-base sm:text-lg leading-7">
              I‚Äôm currently seeking an Engineering or Tech Management internship for Summer 2026, where I can contribute my skills and continue growing at the intersection of technology and business.
